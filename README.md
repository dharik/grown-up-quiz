# What is this?
My plan is to put together a series of questions, based on my experiences, that might encourage somebody to start exploring  topics related to living in the "real world." Eventually, I'd like to make it a guided quiz with explanations of why each question is important and links to resources to learn more. 

# The Questions

## Finance
* About how much cash is in your savings account?
* What's your credit score trend in the last 6 months?
* How much total debt you have? Student loans, car loans, home loans, credit card bills?
* How many months would you last on savings if you lost your largest source of income?
* What was the interest rate of the last loan you took? How long did you take to pay it off? How much interest did you pay in total?
  * For example: $10,000 at 4%, with payments of $100/month
* What % of your income do you spend on rent? Car? Groceries?

## Health
* When was your last routine blood test?
* What routine checkups does your health insurance cover?
* Does your dental insurance cover free cleanings? How often? 

## Goal-setting
* Do you know what you want?

## Hobbies
* Do you have any?

# Inspiration
When I graduated college and had a full-time job lined up, I was not ready to live in the "real world." There were things I didn't understand that I wish I had. For example, refinancing my student loans or taking advantage of my health care plan.
