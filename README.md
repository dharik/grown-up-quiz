# What is this?
My plan is to put together a series of questions, based on my experiences, that might encourage somebody to start exploring those topics. Eventually, I'd like to make it a guided quiz with explanations of why each question is important and links to resources to learn more. 

# The Questions

## Finance
* Can you approximate how much money you have in your savings account right now?
* Do you know how to look up your credit score?
* Do you know how much total debt you have?
* Can you estimate how long you'd last if you lost your largest source of income?
* Do you know of any tools to help you calculate total interest paid on a loan? 
  * For example: $10,000 at 4%, with payments of $100/month
* What % of your income do you spend on rent? Car? Groceries?

## Health
* Can you recall the last time **you** scheduled a routine blood test?
* Do you know what routine checkups your health insurance covers?

# Inspiration
When I graduated college and had a full-time job lined up, I was not ready to live in the "real world." There were things I didn't understand that I wish I had. For example, refinancing my student loans or taking advantage of my health care plan.
